      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program is designed to solve Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks, which involve analyzing the logical relationship between a given premise (a foundational statement) and a hypothesis (a claim to be evaluated). It determines whether the hypothesis entails the premise (i.e., the premise logically implies the hypothesis), contradicts it (i.e., the premise directly opposes the hypothesis), or is neutral (i.e., neither supports nor opposes it). The program works by using a DSPy framework, specifically a ChainOfThought module integrated with an NLIClassifier, to generate step-by-step reasoning that breaks down the analysis process. This reasoning is then used to output a final label from the set {'entailment', 'neutral', 'contradiction'}, making the process transparent and structured for tasks involving textual entailment evaluation.\n",

It determines whether the hypothesis entails the premise (i.e., logically follows from it), contradicts it, or is neutral (neither entails nor contradicts). The program works by utilizing a DSPy framework: it defines a signature for the inputs and outputs, then employs a ChainOfThought approach with an NLIClassifier module.

      "This program is designed to solve Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks, which involve analyzing the logical relationship between a given premise (a foundational statement) and a hypothesis (a claim to be evaluated). It determines whether the hypothesis entails the premise (i.e., the hypothesis logically follows from the premise), contradicts it (i.e., the hypothesis is inconsistent with the premise), or is neutral (i.e., the hypothesis is unrelated or neither supported nor contradicted by the premise). The program works by using a DSPy framework, specifically a ChainOfThought mechanism with an NLIClassifier, to generate step-by-step reasoning that explains the analysis process. This reasoning is then used to output a final label from the options 'entailment', 'neutral', or 'contradiction'. In practice, it takes inputs like premise and hypothesis, processes them through the classifier, and produces structured outputs including the reasoning and label.\n",
